## What is this?

This project is a guide to get you started on modding your Wii. It's really easy to do, and this guide will tell you the do's and dont's of Wii homebrew.

## What's homebrew?

Homebrew is content which allows you to run any content on your system. ANY content.
There is a big homebrew community for the Wii, and many apps, games and utilites to enjoy.

## Get started

Let's get started with modding your console! First, we'll need to choose an exploit.

[str2hax](https://example.com) uses a DNS server and exploits the **User Agreements** in the settings on your Wii. It is the easiest on this list, and can be done over WiFi.

[LetterBomb](https://example.com) uses the Wii's message board to launch a boot file on your SD Card.

**This guide does not include the vWii (Wii U) or the Wii Mini!** Following this guide may brick your vWii or Wii Mini!
For a good guide for the vWii and the Wii Mini, I suggest you check out [wii.guide](https://wii.guide). It has a detailed guide on how to mod the two consoles.
